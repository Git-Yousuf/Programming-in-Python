Error - Any kind of unexpected output.
"""

"""
Three Main Categories of error:
1. Compiler error ( Syntax Error ) - happen when the code is being built either by an interpreter or by an compiler which prevent your code from running.
2. Runtime Error - happens when code runs but which make your program crash in some way.
3. Logical Error - do not make your program crash but result in an incorrect behaviour.
"""

"""
Very Common Runtime Error are:
1. Null reference or Null Pointer Exception
2. Array index out of bounds
3. Running out of memory
4. Floating Pointer Exception
5. Segmentataion Fault
"""

"""
Very Common Logic errors are:
1. using == instead of the equals method
2. infinite loops
3. misunderstanding of operators
4. starting or ending at the wrong index of an array
5. Misplaced parentheses
"""

"""
Debugging Techniques:
1. Reactive Techniques - print debugging
2. Pre emptive Techniques - Assertions, Logging
3. Debugger
"""

"""
Documentation:
- Textual information within a program
- Helps to convey the meaning of the program to human readers who need to understand, modify or debug the program.
"""

"""
Forms of documentation:
1. Inherent Documentation.
2. Inline Documentation.
3. Header comments.
4. External Documentation.
5. User Manual.
