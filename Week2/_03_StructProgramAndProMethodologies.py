# A Paradigm is the preferred approach to programming that a language supports or we can say that it's programming style.

"""
Programming Paradigm defines:
1. Style
2. capabilities
3. Limitations
"""

"""
Different Programming Paradigm:
1. Procedural Programming - Ex: fortran and cobol
2. Structural Programming - 
3. Object Oriented Programming - 
"""

"""
Procedural Programming:
1. divide the code in procedures: routines. subroutines, methods etc..
2. provide instuctions to the computer by following set of steps
3. program code is divided into group of smaller programs which are also referred to as procedures or subroutines or functions.

Advantages:
1. Division of work
2. Debugging and testing
3. Maintainability of code
4. Reusability
5. Procedures share global data
"""

"""
Structural Programming (also known as modular programming):
1. application programme should be broken up into a hierarchy of modules or autonomous elements, some of which may also contain other autonomous elements.
2. allows the programmer to understand the program to understand the program easily.

Structured programming employs methods using following:
1. Top-down analysis for problem solving.
2. Modularization for program structure and organization.
3. Structured code for the individual modules.

Advantages
1. Easier to read and understand.
2. Easier to Maintain.
3. Development is easier as it requires less effort and time.
4. Easier to Debug.
5. Modular Approach.
"""

"""
object-oriented programming - which is built on objects, and it tries to
include the benefits of modularity and reusability.

Object oriented programming paradigm allows decomposition of the system into the
number of entities called objects and then ties properties and function to these objects.

Advantages
1. Programs are divided into simple elements referred to as object
2. Programs organized around objects, grouped in classes
3. Data is hidden from external functions.
4. Functions operate on the properties of an object.
5. Follow the bottom-up approach in oop design
