# What is algorithm? - step by step problem solving process in which a solution is arrived in a finite amount of time.

"""
Properties of algorithm:
1. Input - what the algorithm takes in as input
2. Output - what the algorithm produces as output
3. Definiteness/unambigious
4. Correctness
5. Finiteness
6. Effectiveness
"""

# Why we need algorithm? - for a better design and program 

# A good algorithm is backbone of a good program.

"""
Algorithm :
1. Use Natural language
2. Written by domain expert
3. software and hardware independent
4. analyze algorithms
"""

"""
Algorithm representation:
1. Pseudo code
2. Flowcart

"""
How to write an algorithm:
1. The problem that is to be solved
2. The constraints of the problem
3. The Input to be taken
4. The Output to be expected
5. The Solution to the problem
