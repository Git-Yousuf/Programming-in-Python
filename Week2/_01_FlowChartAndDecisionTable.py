Why diagrammatic representation? 
1. Best way of information sharing.
2. Problem solving.
3. clear communication.
4. easy to understand.
5. clear representaion of complex processes.

Diagrammatic Approach makes a best way of information sharing.

Diagrammatic Approach is considered as a method for clear communication between the team members.

Diagram is more easy to understand than textual information.

Algorithm - finite sequence of well defined instructions to solve a problem.

FlowChart - graphical or diagrammatic representation of steps (Algorithm).

Basic Flowchart symbols:
1. Arrow -> Flow Arrow -> shows the process's order of operations 
2. Capsule -> Terminal -> Indicates the beginning and ending of the program or sub-process
3. Rectangle -> Process -> A box indicates some particular operation
4. Diamond -> Decision -> represents a decision or branching point
5. slanting square -> Input/ Output -> represents information entering or leaving the system
6. Cheese Cake-> Data file or database -> Data represented by a cylinder (disk drive)
7. Rectangle with 2 side borders -> Predefined Process -> Shows named process which is defined elsewhere

Decision table - concise visual representation for specifing which actions to perform depending on given conditions.

Why Decision Table?
1. Very effective tool used for complex software testing
2. helps to check all possible combinations of conditions for testing and testers can also identify missed conditions easily.
3. Representation is simple

Disadvantage: When the number of input increases the table will become more complex
